# NotKobayashiMaru

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.0.

## Node

I used the 16.20 version of Node (but it runs with >14)

## Install Dependencies

Run `npm install` to install all the fun dependencies I used.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Chrome on MacOs

The "device toolbar" in inspect could be a little glitchy some times, refreshing the page will solve 99.99% of the problems

## Error management

Try breaking the API url for the error message

## Fun fact

I would have loved to use ngx-infinite-scroll but it didn't collaborate with the angular/core, angular/cli, webpcack, babel, node.js and maybe even with the operating system I actually have on my Mac. So I decided to create a little silly infinite-scroll by myself.
It is not perfect, but it works üëç
